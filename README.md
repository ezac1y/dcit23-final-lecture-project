## Final Lecture Project
Yray, Zacarias N.
BSCS 1A

### Lab 1
We used Java and the Scanner tool to calculate the average hourly wage of an employee.
### Lab 2 
Still using Java and Scanner, we worked on a program that shows an employee's monthly and yearly salary.
### Lab 3 
In this lab, we added different work roles like manager, supervisor, and others to our program.
### Lab 4 
We continued working with employee info, but this time we created a basic GUI window with input fields and a submit button.
### Lab 5 
We built a simple quiz app using a GUI. It checks if the answer is correct, and if the answer is missing or wrong, the quiz wonâ€™t move forward.
### Lab 6
We created a to-do list app that lets users add tasks with a name, description, and status.
### Midterm Lab Exam
For the midterm, we made a support ticket system for an IT support team. Users can submit issues or feedback, and tickets are handled in the order they come in (first come, first served).
### Final Lab Exam
In the final exam, we built a fully working calculator with a GUI, just like the ones on phones. It has a clean design and includes basic functions like addition and multiplication.
